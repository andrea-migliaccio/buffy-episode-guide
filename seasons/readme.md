# Buffy the Vampire Slayer – Episode Importance Guide

Welcome to a comprehensive, continuity-focused guide to **Buffy the Vampire Slayer**.  
This project is designed to help both new viewers and longtime fans navigate the series with clarity — especially if you prefer a *selective watch* rather than viewing all 144 episodes.

Each season includes:
- A short overview of the main story arcs  
- A full episode list with importance classification  
- Concise episode summaries  
- **Key Story Notes** explaining continuity, lore, character introductions, and callbacks  

The goal is to provide an easy way to understand *which episodes truly matter* and *why*, while still capturing important story seeds hidden inside otherwise skippable episodes.

## 🧭 How to Use This Guide

Every season follows the same table structure:

| Code | Title | Importance | Description | Key Story Notes |
|------|--------|------------|-------------|-----------------|
| SxxEyy | Episode title | FONDAMENTAL / IMPORTANT / DISPENSABLE / FILLER | Short plot summary | Continuity, lore, character intros, future callbacks |

### **Importance Levels**

- **FONDAMENTAL** — Essential to the core storyline or major Buffyverse continuity  
- **IMPORTANT** — Significant character development or mythology with future impact  
- **DISPENSABLE** — Skippable, but may contain useful minor threads  
- **FILLER** — Largely standalone with little to no impact on continuity  

### **Key Story Notes**

This column highlights:
- crucial character introductions  
- lore and mythology seeds  
- plot points referenced again in later seasons  
- relationship developments that shape future arcs  
- ties to the spin-off *Angel* when relevant  

This makes it possible to **skip filler episodes without losing context**.
