# Season 4 Overview

Season 4 marks a major transition for Buffy and the Scoobies: they leave high school behind and enter adulthood, college, and more complicated emotional territory.  
A new institutional adversary appears — **The Initiative**, a government-backed organization that studies, captures, and experiments on demons.

Key arcs:
- Buffy adapts to college life and new relationships  
- Introduction of **Riley Finn** and the Initiative  
- Spike becomes a recurring anti-hero after receiving a behavior-modifying chip  
- Willow’s relationship with **Tara** begins  
- The Big Bad “Adam” explores themes of identity, technology, and militarization  
- The season’s finale, *Restless*, is one of the most symbolically rich episodes of the series  

Season 4’s tone is more experimental, with standalone episodes that explore character psychology and transitions into adulthood.
