# Season 6 Overview

Season 6 is the darkest and most emotionally mature season of *Buffy the Vampire Slayer*.  
It focuses heavily on themes of trauma, addiction, grief, self-destruction, and the painful complexity of adulthood.  
Instead of a traditional “Big Bad,” the season centers around the *internal struggles* of the characters — especially Buffy and Willow — while “The Trio” act as comedic antagonists until darkness takes over.

Major arcs:
- Buffy’s resurrection and resulting depression  
- Spike and Buffy’s destructive relationship  
- Willow’s escalating addiction to magic  
- Dawn’s abandonment trauma and kleptomania  
- Xander and Anya’s relationship collapse  
- “The Trio” (Warren, Jonathan, Andrew) escalating from nuisance to threat  
- Willow’s transformation into **Dark Willow**, the final Big Bad of the season  

Season 6 is controversial, but also one of the richest in character development.
