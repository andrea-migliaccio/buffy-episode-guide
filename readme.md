# Buffy the Vampire Slayer – Episode Importance Guide

This project provides a structured, episode-by-episode guide for **Buffy the Vampire Slayer**, aimed at:

- **New viewers** who want to understand which episodes are essential to the main storyline.
- **Rewatchers** who want to focus on the key arcs while skipping less relevant episodes.

Each episode is categorized using four levels of importance:

- **FONDAMENTAL (Fundamental)** – Core to the main story arc; must-watch.
- **IMPORTANT** – Builds character arcs, lore, mythology, or introduces relevant elements.
- **DISPENSABLE** – Not crucial, but still contributes something minor (themes/character moments).
- **FILLER** – Entirely skippable without losing any important continuity.

The project aims to be **objective where possible**, and **transparent when subjective judgment is required**.

### 📝 Classification Disclaimer

The importance rating assigned to each episode is **not a judgment of its quality**.  
Some episodes categorized as *IMPORTANT*, *DISPENSABLE*, or even *FILLER* are still considered by many fans (and critics) to be excellent television.

The classification reflects **continuity and relevance to the overarching story**, not artistic or emotional value.

For example:
- **S04E10 — “Hush”**, one of the most acclaimed and innovative episodes of the entire series, is not strictly *FONDAMENTAL* to the primary plot arc, yet it remains a fan favorite and a standout of the medium.

In short:  
👉 *“Importance to the main storyline” does not always equal “quality”.*  
This project’s goal is to help viewers navigate continuity — not evaluate the worth of the episodes themselves.
